Generic types test
Bounded generic types test (? extends T and ? super T)
Nested generics tests (including with bounds)

Raw types test (currently raw types throw error!)

Many fields test.

Field-name-collides-with-method-name test.

Already existing method test (should not generate if method already exists. Just emit warning?)

Visibility tests

Mutually recursive types test

Inner class test.

Many overrides test (especially with overriding field tightening type bound but also being hidden)

Implement strategies. Then write strategy tests.

Target field modifiers test
  - test public, protected, default, private visibilities on field.
  - test all others: final, transient, volatile, synchronized.
    - todo error on synchronized? Or inherit modifiers? Properties should always be accessed on gui thread anyways...
    - todo support static? It wouldn't be a (javafx) POJO then, would it? Maybe a global property across controllers.
